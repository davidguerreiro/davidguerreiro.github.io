						These are the most worth-mentionable websites I've built. All of them have been built from scratch, with me in charge of both front-end and back-end development.

						<h3><i class="icon-cog"></i>PSP-Informática</h3>
						<p>
							PSP-Informática is a spanish IT company focused on computer mainteneance. They are both selling computer related products and ofering different IT servicies.
						</p>
						<p>
							This website was made from scratch. The desing is classic, keeping a formal structure. This web page is used to provide further information about the servicies that the company is offering now. They can also both get in contact with the company and dowload some antivirus trial versions.
						</p>

						<h3><i class="icon-cog"></i>Aula de Fotografía Subterránea (Work in progress)</h3>
						<p>
							"Aula de Fotografía Subterránea" is a group based in Spain. They are making trips and exploring differents caves and mountains and taking photos as well. Therefore, they need also and space online to show both their activities and the photos they have taken.
						</p>
						<p>
							So this web page is a blog that I have built from scratch. There are two differents parts in this web: the blog side, where you can see the post, send comments and more, and the managment side, where the admins can publish a post, add a new administrator and more options. I have made the whole CMS from the ground up mainly with PHP. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm working in this website now so don't worry if you see that any section is not operative at the moment.

						<h3><i class="icon-cog"></i>Montearenas</h3>
						<p>
							Montearenas is another spanish IT company focused on fixing both secondhand and new devices and computer accesories. Then they sell it through eBay and this web page.
						</p>
						<p>
							They told me that they wanted an e-shop and this one has to be made with PrestaShop. This is the only web page I have done with a framework, and dealing with PrestaShop was really an experience for me. Anyway, I was only in charge of the CSS part. Also I had to develop some functions with PHP.
