					<h3><i class="icon-user"></i>About me</h3>
					<p>
						Hi! I'm <b>David Guerreiro</b>, a spanish web developer based in London. I'm passionate about the web so I have moved to the UK in order to improve my skills as a web developer.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a freelance, I have always used the latest standards to develop websites in a professional way. I have spent most of my time working whit <b>PHP, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript (including libraries like jQuery)</b> and sometimes with responsive design as well. I'm also developing a videogame as a side project.
					</p>
					<p>
						I write code using <b>Sublime Text 2</b>. I keep my task organized using <b>Redbooth</b> and my code using <b>git</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I have to write code, I always keep it neat and tidy. This is something really important for me because is really annoying to fix a program when you can't understand the code. For now, I always develop web sites <b>from scratch</b>, without frameworks. In my opinion, this is the best way to learn. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I really love playing basketball in my spare time. 
					</p>
					<p>
						 At the moment, <b>I'm looking for a web developer position</b>, so if you need someone, don't hesitate to contact me. You can either <a href="https://twitter.com/Guerrebasket" title="Twitter" target="_blanck">fire me a tweet</a> or <a href="mailto:me@davidguerreiro.com" title="Developer mail">send me an e-mail</a>.

					<h3><i class="icon-file-code"></i>Skills</h3>
					<p>
						The language I have experience the most is PHP. Although, working as a web developer, I have dealt with many more technologies like:
						<ul>
							<li><b>PHP</b>: I have always developed dedicated CMS from the ground up, using pure PHP. In addition, I have used well-known libraries, like PrestaShop and WordPress.</li>
							<li><b>MySQL</b>: I have developed robust databases schemes and ER Models. For me, the design of the database is really important. An application with a bad database scheme can't work properly. I have strong knowledge about SQL language as well.</li> 
							<li><b>HTML5</b>: I have been focused in write a SEO-friendly HTML, using the latest standard of this language. Also I always keep the content separated for the design.</li>
							<li><b>CSS3</b>: My CSS code is always well commented and tidy. I worry about it being cross-browser and responsive.</li>
							<li><b>JavaScript</b>:I have experience with core Javascript, but I have mainly worked with JQuery. I know how to implement any kind of plugin when I need one.</li>
							<li><b>WordPress</b>: I have a full understanding about WordPress procedures and how to deal with it. I know either how to resolve any problem or implement any solution in both site / admin side by just theming or developing a new plugin.</li>
						</ul>

					<h3><i class="icon-up"></i>Aspirations</h3>
					<p>
						At the moment, I would like to work in a company which worries about the way they deal with code and how they keep up-to-date. Also I would like to spend my time working with high-end developers who have more experience than me. I think that this is a good way to both improve as a web developer and share new ideas and methods about developing.
					</p>
					<p>
					 	I would prefer to work in a small company that I can grow with rather than a big one. There are better ways to communicate between the workmates. I enjoy attending conferences about the latest standards of technology.
					</p>
					<p>
						Therefore, I aim to work with the best professionals here in London in order to gain more experience. That's what I really want to do.
