					<h3>About me</h3>
					<p>
						Hi!! My name is <b>David Rodr√≠guez Guerreiro</b>, I'm 23. I love everything about development and programing but I'm mostly interested in web stuff, like desing or performance.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I have to write code, I always keep my scripts tidy, clean and well commented. This is something really important for me because is really annoying to fix a program when you can't understand it. For now, I always develop web sites <b>from scratch</b>, without frameworks. In my opinion, this is the best way to learn. I write code using <b>Sublime Text 2</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						I really love playing basketball in my spare time. Also I'm developing a videogame for myself. I have been working a few years in that.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have moved to London recently and I'm looking for a web developer position, so if you are looking for someone like me, don`t hesitate to get in contact with me. You can either use the contact section in this website or <a href="malito:guerrebasket@hotmail.es" title="Developer mail">send me an e-mail</a>.

				<h3><i class="icon-html5"></i>Looking for full time in London</h3>
				<p>
					Nowdays, every web developer who works in a professional way must have a strong knowledge about <b>HTML5</b>. This is the main tool I always use when I have to make a new website.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm taking advantage of the new HTML 5 contributions, I mean, the new tags and especially the new attributes which allow me to develop a new form validation system using less JS code than before, among other things.
				</p>
				<p>
					All my HTML scripts are independent of the web desing, I mean, I have never used tags like <b>&lt;font&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;span&gt;</b>. I already have CSS to set everything about the desing. Of course, I have developed my websites using the new HTML5 tags <b>&lt;header&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;nav&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;section&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;article&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;footer&gt;</b>and more.
				</p>
				<p class="strengths">
					Strengths:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Full understanding  of the new HTML5 tags and attributes.</li>
					<li>Webs well opimized for SEO keeping good habits writting HTML code.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><i class="icon-css3"></i>Interest:</h3>
				<p>
					CSS is the tecnology I use to built the design of my websites. I have always considered myself as a classic programer rather than a designer, but I have to admit that I really enjoy working with CSS. It has a lot of possibilities, from changing the color of a word to making a full animation in your web. The more I play with the CSS properties, the more I like it.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I have to write a CSS file, I keep my code neat, tabulated, clean and commented. I try to not repeat anything and reuse as code as possible in order to get a well-performance CSS file.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also I have experience developing <b>responsive websites</b> with media querys, adaptative desing and adapted images.
				</p>
				<p class="strengths">
					Strengths:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Great knowledge about the differents CSS classes and atributes.</li>
					<li>Tidy,clean and commented CSS files.</li>
					<li>Content and desing always separated.</li>
					<li>Experience with Responsive Desing.</li>
